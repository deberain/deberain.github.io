My name is Jonathan Falvey. I am a 4th year undergrad student at University of Limerick, currently studying Computer Systems. As part of our fourth and final year in the course, we must undertake a Final Year Project. The topic I chose for my FYP was "Build a Next Word Predictor".

I've created this blog to log my progress in researching and developing my next word predictor. I expect to update this blog weekly, up until the completion of my FYP of course.
