## Overview

Welcome, this will be my blog detailing my progress on researching and building a next word predictor as part of my final year project for UL.

I will be aiming to update this on a weekly basis. The contents of the posts will consist of the topics I've looked into that week, what I learned and, later on down the road, my progress on developing my own next word predictor.

## Plans For Week 04

In this coming week I plan to research how Next Word Predictors function. I'll be investigating common approaches to building one. One suggestion that was made to me was a combination of Word2Vec and a Neural Network. I also briefly skimmed through videos of predictors being trained using Keras and Long Short Term Memory. I want to take a deeper dive into these approaches and determine if there if one is more preferable to the other. 

If time permits later in the year, I had an idea to build next word predictors using different techniques and examining the difference in accuracy, if any.

That'll be it for this week. I imagine I'll post an update again next Sunday.
